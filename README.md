# Quizz
As a part of a 'YfS’ initiative, ‘Lab on Wheels’, our team was asked to design and develop a web application or website. ‘Lab on Wheels’ is going to be conducting a science quiz for students across government schools in Karnataka. This website is intended to be used as a platform that enables students from participating government schools to take up the science quiz. 

The website has a home page, from which participants can proceed to the registration page, while the admin can login to the admin page. The home page also consists of the YfS logo and the ‘Lab on Wheels’ logo.

On clicking on the ‘Take Quiz’ button, participants are led to the registration page where they enter their details and receive instructions on how to take the quiz. Once done, the quiz starts, and a countdown timer ensures that participants get the same amount of time to complete the quiz. 

The quiz consists of three parts - multiple choice questions, true or false questions and image based questions. The participant will overall be given an hour to complete all the sections. The score of each participant will be calculated and sent to the admin’s email. 

In the admin section, the admin will be given the options of uploading a file with the questions or previewing the uploaded file. On uploading the file, the new set of questions is updated on the website. After uploading the file, the admin can have a look at how the questions appear to the participants with the help of the preview option. After having completed the process, the admin can log out of the website using the logout button.
